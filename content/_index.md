  #        Learning Robust and Explainable Representation for Rare Disease Diagnosis From Facial Images  
  #        Feb 2023 â€“ July 2023  
  #        â€¢ A research project concentrates on identifying rare genomics disease syndromes.  
  #        â€¢ An experimental benchmark was designed to accurately indicate the disorder type.  
  #        â€¢ Both fully supervised and semi-supervised training approaches were conducted.  
  #        â€¢ My contribution to the project was mainly to conduct different experimental setups with various model architectures and loss functions as well as preparing the training data.
